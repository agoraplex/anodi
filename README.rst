==============================================
 `anodi`: The `Agoraplex` Annotations Toolkit
==============================================

`anodi` [#etymology]_ is a decorator-based backport of :pep:`3107`,
function annotations, to Python 2.7, along with a limited set of
:mod:`~anodi.tools` based on those annotations (e.g.,
:func:`~anodi.tools.document`, which hoists annotations into the
docstring, for the `Sphinx`__ `autodoc`__ extension to find).

.. [#etymology] The Welsh for `annotation` is `anodi` (according to
   `Google Translate`__). It won out over translations to other
   languages because it's short, and phonetically (and, thus,
   mnemonically), related. It's also a tribute to my friend, `Allen
   Briggs`__, who passed away, unexpectedly, in March of 2012. Allen
   was an amateur student of Welsh, when he wasn't busy `maintaining
   the mac68k port of NetBSD`__, or, as a consequence of his \*BSD
   work, being `credited in iOS`__.
